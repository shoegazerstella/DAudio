# DAudio

A Decentralized platform for Audio publishing.

This Smart Contract will save the hash of an audio file on the blockchain, together with some additional metadata in order to be able to retrieve:

* the entire catalogue given an address
* song metadata given an hash

By publishing the audio on IPFS it will be possible to stream the audios.

Funding for the creator address will be made available as soon as I have some time to figure out how to do it :)
